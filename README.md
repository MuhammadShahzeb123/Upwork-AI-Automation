## Overview

The Upwork Automation Project aimed to streamline the job application process by:

- Scraping job postings from Upwork.com.
- Extracting relevant information about clients who posted jobs.
- Finding clients' websites and email addresses.
- Sending automated emails to clients using AI-generated content.

While the intention was to enhance efficiency for freelancers, the reliance on AI technology proved to be a major hurdle.

## Reasons for Deprecation

The decision to deprecate this project was influenced by several key factors:

1. **Inadequate AI Performance**: The AI model used for generating email responses did not consistently produce satisfactory results, leading to ineffective communication with potential clients.
2. **High Dependency on AI**: The project's functionality was heavily reliant on AI capabilities that were insufficient for the desired outcomes.
3. **Maintenance Challenges**: The complexity of maintaining an AI-driven system made it difficult to ensure reliable performance over time.
4. **User Feedback**: Input from users indicated that the tool did not meet their expectations, resulting in limited engagement and effectiveness.
